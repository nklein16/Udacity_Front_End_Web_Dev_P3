# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

This Classic Arcade Game is a variation of the classic Frogger arcade game, and is, as of this writing, the third project out of five for Udacity's Front End Web Development course. 

## Goals/Winning

I only did the most basic implementation of the game.  The goal of the game is to move the player across the road safely to the water on the other side without getting hit by an enemy, which in this case was only the beetle.  Once across, the player is reset to the starting position and a modal pops up telling the player "Congratulations! You made it to the river!", after which play can start over again.

## Movement and Controls

Users move the hero character by using the main up/right/left/down arrow keys on their keyboard.

## List of Resources

I referenced this video by Ben Cunnningham, but that's about it:

I did something similar to this game in an Android programming class years ago, so the notion of dealing with collisions, keeping the player from going off the page, and setting up the enemies so they appear to (a) be moving and (b) be able to enter and exit the screen was already somewhat familiar to me.  

## Project Requirements
How do I complete this project?
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking their submissions.

Note that this README contains only slight revisions to the one posted by Alex Sales at https://github.com/alexsales/frontend-nanodegree-frogger-arcade-game.  S/He did an excellent job writing the README and so I thought I would use it as a template for my own README (this very document).
